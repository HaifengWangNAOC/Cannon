Introduction
============

This is the software package used for *The Cannon*,
a data-driven approach to determining stellar labels (parameters
and abundances) for a vast set of stellar spectra. This version is tailored
specifically for APOGEE spectra.

A brief overview of *The Cannon* and the associated software package is below.
For more details on the method and its successful application to APOGEE DR10
spectra, see Ness et al. 2015.
