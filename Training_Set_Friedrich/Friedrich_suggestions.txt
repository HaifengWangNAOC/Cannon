1m targets:

    Spectra: https://data.sdss.org/sas/bosswork/apogee/spectro/redux/r5/stars/apo1m/
    Labels: diverse... https://trac.sdss3.org/wiki/APOGEE/Observing/Observed1mTargets,
    https://trac.sdss3.org/wiki/APOGEE/TargetSelectionPage/Possible1mTargets ---> this requires some nasty catalogue work...
    for the Hipparcos stars, we will have to think about whether/in which way to best include the parallax info... the file of ASPCAP Labels + parallaxes is here: https://cloud.aip.de/public.php?service=files&token=2ee87e1e036e5438dae248acf11e91ab0f6b9e51&path=/1m_hip_plx_withDR12.fits (865 stars)
    There is also an overlap between APOGEE and Labels from the high-res optical sample of Fuhrmann 2011 which he kindly provided to me (please find it attached)

APOKASC:

    In addition to providing precise log g, APOKASC has another advantage: Dmitriy Bizyaev (if I remember right) has calculated v sin i for the whole sample... this should probably also be a label for The Cannon...?
    The Catalogue is being updated to DR12 by several people right now, but it seems save for our purposes to go with the published one:
