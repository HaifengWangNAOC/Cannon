What remains for Version 1.0 
- Imagine that the residual of each best-fit spectrum is a 1D list, stack them and sort by each of the labels. Then we will see whether all stars have deviations at a particular wavelength from the best-fit model irrespective of the label -- if the quadratic model is general enough, then the 2D residual should show nothing but noise. (Jo Bovy has done something similar?) -- don't forget to normalize by the sources of variance and scatter, see HW's e-mail
- Go through & compile questions and observations from the diagnostic plots
- Continuum normalization
- Documentation
- E-mail HWR, MKN, DH introducing this version

For Version 1.1
- Restructure to incorporate David Hogg's workflow suggestions

For way further down the road:
- spectral model needs to be allowed to vary from pixel to pixel (Gaussian process)
- create non-identical subsets of the training set
- shot noise in the creation of a training set
- check the scatter at each pixel
