Remaining for Version 1.1 (before HW takes a look...)
- Remaining diagnostic tests
- Implement continuum normalization
- Version Control?

Then, after Tuesday:
- Learn how to use gh-pages

For way further down the road:
- spectral model needs to be allowed to vary from pixel to pixel (Gaussian process)
- create non-identical subsets of the training set
- shot noise in the creation of a training set
- check the scatter at each pixel
