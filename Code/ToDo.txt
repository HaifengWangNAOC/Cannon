What remains for Version 1.0 
- Go through and carefully check all code and outputs
- Documentation
- Compile questions and observations to share with the others
- E-mail HWR, MKN, DH introducing this version

For Version 1.1
- Restructure to incorporate David Hogg's workflow suggestions
- Implement continuum normalization

For way further down the road:
- spectral model needs to be allowed to vary from pixel to pixel (Gaussian process)
- create non-identical subsets of the training set
- shot noise in the creation of a training set
- check the scatter at each pixel
