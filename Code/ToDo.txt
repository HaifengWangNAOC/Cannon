TIMELINE
Friday  - Incorporate David Hogg's workflow suggestions
        - Imagine that the residual of each best-fit spectrum is a 1D list, stack them and sort by each of the labels. Then we will see whether all stars have deviations at a particular wavelength from the best-fit model irrespective of the label -- if the quadratic model is general enough, then the 2D residual should show nothing but noise. (Jo Bovy has done something similar?) -- don't forget to normalize by the sources of variance and scatter, see HW's e-mail
        - Go through & compile questions and observations (ex. what is chi sq)      
        - E-mail to HW, Melissa, and David Hogg, which will involve the above
        - Continuum normalization
        - Documentation

QUESTIONS
- What is a S/N of training spectra that "isn't high enough"?
- What is a set size that "isn't big enough"?
- What is the actual chi squared? Why should that dotted line be there...? 

new features:
- Recognize if a spectrum has properties that are not covered by the spectral model. Auto-correlation of residual spectrum (if the residual is actually dominated by noise, should get a delta function)

farther down the road:
- spectral model needs to be allowed to vary from pixel to pixel (Gaussian process)
- create non-identical subsets of the training set
- shot noise in the creation of a training set
- check the scatter at each pixel

I don't understand:
- MCM_rotate_all matrix...what is it? it's the coefficients multiplied by the inverse covariance (1/errors^2). Just has to be the right shape for matrix multiplication to work. MKN will send me the maths in the next couple of days.
