TIMELINE
First draft done by the end of the day on Friday.
Thurs   - Plot leading coefficients as a function of wavelength
        - Histogram of the chi-sq of fits
        - In the above hist, a dashed line corresponding to DOF (npixels - nlabels)
        - Continuum normalization
        - Overplot each Cannon best-fit spec with original spec
        - Imagine that the residual of each best-fit spectrum is a 1D list, stack them and sort by each of the labels. Then we will see whether all stars have deviations at a particular wavelength from the best-fit model irrespective of the label -- if the quadratic model is general enough, then the 2D residual should show nothing but noise. (Jo Bovy has done something similar?) -- don't forget to normalize by the sources of variance and scatter, see HW's e-mail
        - Incorporate David Hogg's workflow suggestions...or at least explain to him how mine are different

Fri     - Documentation

new features:
- Warning if the S/N of training spectra isn't high enough
- Warning if the set size isn't big enough
- Recognize if a spectrum has properties that are not covered by the spectral model. Auto-correlation of residual spectrum (if the residual is actually dominated by noise, should get a delta function)

farther down the road:
- spectral model needs to be allowed to vary from pixel to pixel (Gaussian process)
- create non-identical subsets of the training set
- shot noise in the creation of a training set
- check the scatter at each pixel

I don't understand:
- MCM_rotate_all matrix...what is it? it's the coefficients multiplied by the inverse covariance (1/errors^2). Just has to be the right shape for matrix multiplication to work. MKN will send me the maths in the next couple of days.
