1) Run APOGEE munging code
Input: URL, or maybe nothing
Output:
- a length-L rest-frame wavelength vector
- a block N x L of training-set pixel intensities
- a parallel block of inverse variances
- a block N x K of labels
- a block M x L of test-set pixel intensities
- a parallel block of inverse variances

Comments: this code should get the data, shift it to rest frame, read the bad-pixel masks, and build the inverse variance vectors and package them all into rectangular blocks.

2) Run Continuum Wavelengths Code
Input: (the first three inputs to the Main Code)
- a rectangular block that is N x L of pixel values of continuum-normalized spectra
intensities (training set)
- a parallel block of inverse variance values
- a block of N x K labels
Output: a length-L mask of continuum True/False values

3) Run Continuum Normalization code
Input: 
- N x L or M x L block of pixel values
- a parallel block of inverse variance values
- the length-L continuum mask (from above)
Output:
- a N x L or M x L block of continuum-normalized intensities
- a parallel block of rescaled inverse variance values

4) Run Main Code
Input: 
- a rectangular block that is N x L of pixel values of continuum-normalized spectra intensities (training set)
- a parallel block of inverse variance values
- a block of N x K labels
- a rectangular block that is M x L of pixel values of continuum-normalized spectral intensities (test set)
- a parallel block of inverse variance values
- a value for the "polynomial order" of the model
Output:
- a block of M x K labels
- a block of Q x L parameters (coefficients and scatters and so on)
