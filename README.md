TheCannon
=========

This is the code associated with *The Cannon*, a new data-driven method for 
determining stellar labels (physical parameters and chemical abundances) from
stellar spectra in the context of vast spectroscopic surveys. It closely 
follows the method outlined in Ness et al. 2015, although some minor changes 
have subsequently been made. A list of these changes can be found in Ho et al. 
(in prep.)
